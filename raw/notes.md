# Notes


## Data:

> The data for this paper is a revised version of Chacon (2014). It is based on 150 cognates with correspondences across the major subgroups in the family. Cognates are root morphemes following a (C)V(C)V template. Words are written phonemically according to the source of in- formation for each language (for details see Chacon 2014: 280). From the cognate sets and recon- structed forms, 18 proto-consonants were extracted. Due to context-specific patterns of change, the 18 proto-consonants yielded a total of 34 different correspondence sets with a total of 42 dif- ferent reflexes in the extant languages. The proto-consonants along with the reflexes were plot- ted in a matrix, with proto-consonants, conditioning contexts and reflexes of each language in separate columns. The proto-sounds and the conditioning contexts are given in Table 1. The ma- trix with the reflexes in the 21 daughter languages is available in the Supplementary Material.
